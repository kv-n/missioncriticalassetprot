These systems can be as simple as a stand-alone smoke detector, or as complex as thousands of detectors, relays, and notification devices. These systems can also have full integration to activate HVAC systems, elevator recalls, suppression systems and voice evacuation notification.</p>\n                <p>System design of all fire alarm systems are determined by local building codes based on building size and occupancy. MCAP is a proud distributor of Hochiki Systems, as well as having the ability to work with other manufacturers.</p>\n                <p><strong>Detection & Controls:</strong><br /> Detection of a fire begins with smoke, heat, or other advanced sensing technology available on the market. Once a source is located in the structure, intelligent fire alarm panels will quickly control air handlers, the closing of fire doors, recalling elevators, closing fire dampers, locking or unlocking security doors, and notification devices. Controlling these devices prevents the spread of smoke to adjacent areas within the structure and aids in the quick evacuation of the structure. When used in special hazard areas, specialized controls will also release firefighting agents such as clean agent gas, water, or dry chemical. For more information on suppression systems for any type of hazard, click on the fire-suppression link under systems or connect with us at MCAP with any questions.</p>\n                <p><strong>Alarm Notification:</strong><br /> Depending on building size and occupation there are many different notification devices. Most will be familiar with a strobe and a horn. Some cases require a mass notification system with speakers and strobes. These types of systems have pre-recorded messages alerting occupants of the hazard and advising personnel the proper steps to take as the situation unfolds. Mass notification systems also have the ability to be interrupted by a local mic. The mic will take over any sound coming from the speakers and a system wide announcement can be made locally from the fire panel. End users can then give real time updates as they happen. For more information please contact us at MCAP and we will gladly explain the benefits of each type of notification system and their uses as they pertain to your situation.</p>\n                <p><strong>Monitoring:</strong><br /> Assuring your facility is protected 24/7 should a fire and life safety emergency arise is of upmost importance. To provide a greater level of protection MCAP has UL listed monitoring solutions so you are never caught unprepared; day or night. Monitoring systems can be installed on new and existing fire alarm systems. Should an emergency situation arise, our response team will contact the proper emergency response team to respond.

For that reason, MCAP designs, installs, and services some of the industry’s highest quality and most reliable waterless fire protection systems on the market.</p>\n                <p><strong>Clean Agents:</strong> Clean agent suppression systems, like FM-200® and Sapphire®, utilize fire and/or smoke detection to discharge the agent into the protected area.  These systems are perfect for normally occupied and critical infrastructure areas where asset protection is of the upmost priority.  MCAP has partnered with Ansul to provide the industry’s leading fire suppression agents and systems. Typical Application Areas:</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Data Centers</li>\n                    <li>Telecommunication Rooms</li>\n                    <li>Laboratories</li>\n                    <li>Medical Facilities</li>\n                    <li>Museums</li>\n                    <li>Control Rooms</li>\n                </ul>\n                <div>\n                    <button className={`${isOpen ? \"active\" : \"\"}`} onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>FM-200®: FM-200®</button>\n                    <p className={`${isOpen ? \"visible\" : \"hidden\"}`}>is a UL and EPA approved clean gaseous fire suppression agent with zero risk of causing ozone depletion.  FM-200® is a colorless, odorless, and rapid firing agent that works in seconds once discharged.  This agent is readily suited for normally occupied areas that require the protection of high-value assets.</p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                    <button className={`${isOpen3 ? \"active\" : \"\"}`} onClick={() => setIsOpen3(!isOpen3)}>Inert Gasses</button>\n                    <div className={`${isOpen3 ? \"visible\" : \"hidden\"}`}>\n                        <p>Inert gases can be considered some of the most “green” of the fire suppression options.  Inert gases utilize either a single gas or a combination of nitrogen, argon, and/or CO2 to displace the oxygen in the protected area to quickly extinguish fire.  Inert gas systems are typically high pressure extinguishing systems and upon discharge and venting the protected area will quickly return back to its normal atmospheric state.  MCAP can assist in determining if an inert gas system is best suited to your special hazard area.</p>\n                        <p><strong>Inergen®:</strong> Inergen is a blend of 52% Nitrogen, 40% Argon, and 8% CO² that poses zero ozone depletion threat as these are gases already found in the natural atmosphere.  Inergen is safe for normally occupied spaces and is approved by both UL and the EPA. Typical Application Areas:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>Telecommunication Rooms</li>\n                            <li>Data Centers</li>\n                            <li>Control Rooms</li>\n                            <li>Power Plants</li>\n                            <li>Medical Facilities</li>\n                            <li>Laboratories</li>\n                        </ul>\n                        <p><strong>CO²:</strong> CO² systems are highly effective fire suppression systems as CO² quickly fills the space displacing the oxygen and extinguishing the fire.  CO² is colorless, odorless, an asphyxiant and electrically non-conductive; these systems are ideal for areas that have little to no personnel, but contain sensitive equipment.  Upon proper ventilation of the protected space after discharge, personnel can resume work as usual. Typical Application Areas:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>Engine Rooms</li>\n                            <li>Generators</li>\n                            <li>Flammable Liquid Storage</li>\n                            <li>Large Industrial Machinery</li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </div>\n                    <p className=\"water-systems-burb\"><strong>Water Systems:</strong> Water based systems are the most common fire protection systems today.  These systems are extremely environmentally friendly with no risk of ozone depletion because the extinguishing agent is water.  These systems are very effective means of fire suppression for areas that contain replaceable assets.  Since water is corrosive and highly conductive in nature, these systems should not be used in areas with sensitive equipment or irreplaceable assets.</p>\n                    <div>\n                        <button className={`${isOpen4 ? \"active\" : \"\"}`} onClick={() => setIsOpen4(!isOpen4)}>Pre Action Systems</button>\n                        <p className={`${isOpen4 ? \"visible\" : \"hidden\"}`}>Pre-Action sprinkler systems are a dry-pipe, water based system; meaning that no water is held in the piping network.  Instead, water is held from the piping network by pressurized air and an electronic valve known as a pre-action valve.  The valve initiates upon flame, smoke, or heat detection in the protected area.  The dual action initiation provides extra protection from inadvertent discharge making it perfect for water sensitive areas containing critical equipment or assets.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div>\n                        <button className={`${isOpen5 ? \"active\" : \"\"}`} onClick={() => setIsOpen5(!isOpen5)}>Deluge Systems</button>\n                        <p className={`${isOpen5 ? \"visible\" : \"hidden\"}`}>Like pre-action, Deluge is a dry pipe fire sprinkler system, only the sprinkler heads remain constantly open and the pipe is not pressurized by air.  Upon triggering of the system, water flows through all of the sprinkler heads connected to that system so that the fire is quickly extinguished and the threat of the fire spreading is minimized.  High hazard areas such as power plants and chemical storage facilities are ideal for this type of water based system.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div>\n                        <button className={`${isOpen6 ? \"active\" : \"\"}`} onClick={() => setIsOpen6(!isOpen6)}>Foam Systems</button>\n                        <div className={`${isOpen6 ? \"visible\" : \"hidden\"}`}>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Low Expansion - where the bubble expansion ratio is small (less than 20 to 1) and the bubble contains high water content.  Low Expansion Foam Fire Extinguishing Systems are applicable to special hazards, usually involving flammable or combustible liquids, such as storage tanks. These systems discharge foam bubbles over the liquid surface to provide a cooling, smothering blanket which progressively covers the liquid surface and extinguishes the fire. The foam blanket can prevent vapor production for some time.</li><br />\n                                <li>Medium and High Expansion - where the expansion ratios are greater from 20 to 1 up to 1,000 to 1. At these expansion ratios, the bubble water content is low and the bubble is relatively light. The foam bubbles are made by mixing a foam concentrate with water to make a foam solution. The foam solution is then mechanically agitated to form bubbles.  High Expansion foam systems are applicable to areas where it might be desirable to fill the space with foam in order to exclude air and smother the fire. Examples of such areas include basements and warehouses.</li><br />\n                                <li>Aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) functions in a similar manner, but with one notable difference: AFFF is capable of producing water solution films which float on the surface of the liquid and help suppress vapor production. However, this beneficial “film” is obtained with some loss of burn-back resistance.</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    <div>\n                        <button className={`${isOpen7 ? \"active\" : \"\"}`} onClick={() => setIsOpen7(!isOpen7)}>Wet Systems</button>\n                        <p className={`${isOpen7 ? \"visible\" : \"hidden\"}`}>A wet pipe sprinkler system is a sprinkler system employing automatic sprinkler heads attached to a piping system containing water and connected to a water supply so that water discharges immediately from sprinklers opened by heat from a fire.  A wet system is used in areas that can be maintained above 40° F. Providing immediate water discharge onto a fire will help to control it quickly and will help prevent it from spreading.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default WaterSystems","import React from 'react'\nimport '../../sass/_footer.scss'\n\nconst Footer = () => {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"footer\">\n            <h2>Mission Critical Asset Protection, Inc</h2>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Footer","import React from 'react';\nimport './sass/_base.scss'\n\nimport { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom'\n\nimport Nav from './components/Nav/Nav'\nimport Home from './components/Home/Home'\nimport Contact from './components/Contact/Contact'\nimport Services from './components/Services/Services'\nimport FireSystems from './components/FireSystems/FireSystems'\nimport WaterSystems from './components/WaterSystems/WaterSystems'\nimport Footer from './components/Footer/Footer'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Nav />\n      <Switch>\n        <Route path=\"/missioncriticalassetprot\" exact component={Home} />\n        <Route path=\"/contact\" exact component={Contact} />\n        <Route path=\"/services\" exact component={Services} />\n        <Route path=\"/fire-systems\" exact component={FireSystems} />\n        <Route path=\"/water-systems\" exact component={WaterSystems} />\n      </Switch>\n      <div id=\"footer\">\n        <Footer />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import { useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { useLocation } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nexport default function ScrollToTop() {\n  const { pathname } = useLocation();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  }, [pathname]);\n\n  return null;\n}","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
