                <p>Fire Alarm systems are the first line of defense and notification should a fire occur in a building. These systems can be as simple as a stand-alone smoke detector, or as complex as thousands of detectors, relays, and notification devices. These systems can also have full integration to activate HVAC systems, elevator recalls, suppression systems and voice evacuation notification.</p>
                <p>System design of all fire alarm systems are determined by local building codes based on building size and occupancy. MCAP is a proud distributor of Hochiki Systems, as well as having the ability to work with other manufacturers.</p>
                <p><strong>Detection & Controls:</strong><br /> Detection of a fire begins with smoke, heat, or other advanced sensing technology available on the market. Once a source is located in the structure, intelligent fire alarm panels will quickly control air handlers, the closing of fire doors, recalling elevators, closing fire dampers, locking or unlocking security doors, and notification devices. Controlling these devices prevents the spread of smoke to adjacent areas within the structure and aids in the quick evacuation of the structure. When used in special hazard areas, specialized controls will also release firefighting agents such as clean agent gas, water, or dry chemical. For more information on suppression systems for any type of hazard, click on the fire-suppression link under systems or connect with us at MCAP with any questions.</p>
                <p><strong>Alarm Notification:</strong><br /> Depending on building size and occupation there are many different notification devices. Most will be familiar with a strobe and a horn. Some cases require a mass notification system with speakers and strobes. These types of systems have pre-recorded messages alerting occupants of the hazard and advising personnel the proper steps to take as the situation unfolds. Mass notification systems also have the ability to be interrupted by a local mic. The mic will take over any sound coming from the speakers and a system wide announcement can be made locally from the fire panel. End users can then give real time updates as they happen. For more information please contact us at MCAP and we will gladly explain the benefits of each type of notification system and their uses as they pertain to your situation.</p>
                <p><strong>Monitoring:</strong><br /> Assuring your facility is protected 24/7 should a fire and life safety emergency arise is of upmost importance. To provide a greater level of protection MCAP has UL listed monitoring solutions so you are never caught unprepared; day or night. Monitoring systems can be installed on new and existing fire alarm systems. Should an emergency situation arise, our response team will contact the proper emergency response team to respond. Giving you peace of mind!</p>
